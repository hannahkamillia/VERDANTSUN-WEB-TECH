> **Project Description**
>
> The main theme of the project we choose is about focusing on the
> importance of sustaining and protecting wildlife. In correlation with
> Sustainable Goal Development, Goal 15 : Life on Land. We came to an
> agreement to develop and create a platform that can advocate our
> vision and mission to the world regarding the importance of preserving
> wildlife. In this project, we decided to choose a theme of
> Organization and also at the same time included with Education.
>
> Our website contains six button pages which are main, home, about us,
> volunteer, contact us and donation. The font we are using is Poppins
> sans-serif for all the pages. The concept for this website is to keep
> a simple and minimalist style yet keep it easy to understand by other
> users surfing through the webpage.
>
> In our website, the user will be greeted on the home page after
> clicking on the link showing our websites. On the other hand, to give
> the user more information about our\
> organization we included an about us page. The motive for 'about us'
> page is to show the motive, plan and what the use of our organization
> is in preserving the wildlife.
>
> In contribution to preserving wildlife, our website includes a
> donation page which encourages users to donate to help the wildlife.
> They can select the amount of donation ranging from RM 5 to RM 50 then
> clicking the submit button and a small pop-up will appear showing
> gratitude for user honorable donation. Plus, our website also provides
> a volunteer page where users can feel free to volunteer to join in any
> of the event offer.There are event offers including Go!Recycle ,
> aiming to achieve a clean environment.Next is Save Wildlife and lastly
> Go! Green.
>
> Our website also includes a contact us page whereas if the user has a
> question regarding our organization they can freely ask by typing in
> their name, email address, the subject of the question and type in the
> question in the 'your message' box then clicking submit. Users can
> also see the contact information of our organization which includes
> our location, phone number, email address and our business hours.
